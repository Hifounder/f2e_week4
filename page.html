                <p>In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there is much running backwards and forwardsamong
                    the crew. Now hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no stayingin any
                    one place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much the samewith
                    him who endeavors the description of the scene. </p>
                <p> We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale's back,the
                    blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But how didso
                    clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particularfriend
                    Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer.</p>
